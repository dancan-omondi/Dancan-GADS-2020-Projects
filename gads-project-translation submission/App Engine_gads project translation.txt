LAB:Google Cloud Fundamentals Getting Started with App Engine
Objectives:
 In this lab,you learn how to perform the following tasks:
   -Initialize App Engine
   -Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
   -Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
   -Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.
 Steps:
   1.Initialize App Engine
     -Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
	    gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
	-Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
	    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
	-Navigate to the source directory:
	    cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
 2.Run Hello World application locally
     At the cloud shell command prompt;
     -Execute the following command to download and update the packages list
	    sudo apt-get update
	 -Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
	    sudo apt-get install virtualenv
	   If prompted, accept and then press Enter
	    Results:virtualenv -p python3 venv
	 -Activate the virtual environment.
	    source venv/bin/activate
	 -Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
	    pip install  -r requirements.txt
	 -Run the application:
	    python main.py
	-In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.
	  Results: Hello World!
	 -At the cloud shell, press the ctrl+C to abort the deployed service
	-To verify that the app is not deployed run the following command.
	   gcloud app instances list
 3. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
    -Navigate to the source directory:
	   cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
	-Deploy your Hello World application.
	   gcloud app deploy
	 If prompted, Do you want to continue accept and then press enter key.
	-Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
	  gcloud app browse
	-Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window
	   Results: Hello World
 4.Disable the application
	-Run the following command to disable the deployed app instance
	   gcloud app instances disable-debug --instance_id
	  When you refresh the browser window used to view the application site, the 404 message will be displayed.
